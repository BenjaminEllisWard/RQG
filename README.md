# Random Question Generator

This ASP.NET Core MVC application allows users to create a question bank and view randomly selected questions. The application relies on Entity Framework to communicate with localDb where questions/answers are stored. **You will have to use EF for your own migration to create a localDb when when first starting from a clone.** If you need help with this, contact me and I will work through it with you.
